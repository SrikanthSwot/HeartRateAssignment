# Heart Rate Calculator 
## Overview 
This project calculates statistics for patients' heart rate data collected over several days in a clinical trial. 
It processes the input data from "heartrate.json" and generates statistics for each day, including minimum, maximum, median beats per minute, and the latest data timestamp. 
The results are then written to an output file "output.json." 
## Requirements 
- Node.js 
- npm
